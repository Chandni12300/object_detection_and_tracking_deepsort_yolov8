# Tracking Object Behaviour

## About
This project focuses on tracking object behavior by leveraging a single camera sensor placed on road infrastructure. 
The notebook and code perform various tasks like object detection and trajectory tracking using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT, collision risk analysis, and more.

### Implemented Features
- Object Detection and Trajectory Tracking using YOLOv8 (Segmentation with DeepSORT)
- Object Detection Validation
- Future Trajectory Prediction
- Collision Risk Analysis
- Real-time Collision Risk Analysis
- Real-time Collision Risk Analysis based on future vehicle movement (6 UseCases)
- Collision Risk Validation
- Traffic Management: Count of Vehicles
- Traffic Management: Congestion
